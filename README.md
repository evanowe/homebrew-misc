# homebrew-misc
This repository only contains (for now) dsniff.rb keg for homebrew, that compiles under Yosemite.

This is tested keg for dsniff to compile properly under Yosemite (10.10.2) and homebrew.

Use:
- 'wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evanowe/homebrew-misc/master/dsniff.rb'
- 'brew install ./dsniff.rb'

Credits to original keg: 'https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-boneyard/blob/master/dsniff.rb' and user https://github.com/zbuc for this patch 'https://github.com/zbuc/homebrew-boneyard/commit/31ae46fa9208f87b97aded1bbc70aff5da8ca45b'
